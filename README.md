P = {States, Initial state, Goal state, Set of permissible actions, Path cost}

Initial State:
Board is empty.

States:
A state is any arrangement of  8 queens on a 8 x 8 square board such that there exist exactly one queen in each row and column such that they remain safe from each other.

Actions:
There are set of permissible actions which are as follows:
